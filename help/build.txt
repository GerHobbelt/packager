Usage: packager build <components> [args...]
       packager build <args...>

build arguments:
  <components>
  +components <components>     Build passed in components and their
                               dependancies using your registered packages.
  -components <components>     Don't use passed in components and their
                               dependancies using your registered packages.
                               Note that dependencies which are shared
                               with '+components' components, are kept.
  +files <files>               Build passed in files and their dependancies
                               using your registered packages.
  -files <files>               Exclude these files from the build.
  -files+deps <files>          Exclude these files and their dependencies
                               from the build.
                               Note that any dependencies of these files
                               are always excluded, even when other files
                               list them too; this contrasts with the
                               dependencies of '-components'.
  +packages <dirs>|<manifests> Use the passed in unregistered packages
                               in addition to the registered packages.
  -packages <packages>         Don't use passed in packages. This lets you
                               build components without dependancies.
  +use-only <packages>         Use only the passed in packages. This lets you
                               build components without dependancies.
  -blocks <blocks>             Exclude optional blocks from the sources of
                               the components you're building.
